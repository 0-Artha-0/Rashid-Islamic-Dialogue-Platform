## Mock policy

Canonical mocks live in `data/mock/`.

Mocks are for development and testing only. They must never be used as production fallback religious content.

If the real pipeline cannot produce a supported answer, the production fallback is an error, abstention, clarification, or referral state.

## Compatibility rule

After this freeze, changing a shared contract requires updating:
1. the Zod schema,
2. canonical mocks,
3. all consuming modules,
4. the Notion contracts reference,
5. the Pull Request description.

Do not silently rename or remove fields used by another module.
